# KataRandomizer

Kata randomizer React project

This is a totally unnecessary app to randomly select a kata and action such as (bunkai, renzoko, kumite or none) for the style selected by the user.

This project was really just an excuse to build an app in React.

To run this app after cloning:
Open the project folder in VS Code
Open a new Terminal then type npm install (first time only) to install the necessary node modules
Next, type npm run dev. You will see a URL such as: http://localhost:5173/ to run the app
